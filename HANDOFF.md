## In flight

- 2026-04-26 — AIR-024 started on `work`: implementing policy-rules §2 formula in `src/salience/engine.ts`, adding `SalienceScore.reversibility`, and converting `tests/salience.test.ts` to table-driven coverage. — Sebastian (Codex)

## Role split

| Side | Tooling | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Nick** | Claude (Opus 4.7) | Spec docs, narrative, demo script, pitch deck, adversarial review |
| **Sebastian** | Codex Cloud | Scaffolding, src/ implementation, tests, persistence, infra |

This split is **flexible** — if Sebastian's throughput slows or Nick wants deeper code ownership, we revisit. Current default per `works-split.md`: Claude shapes "what should this agent do and why," Codex shapes "make the repo actually work." Spec docs Nick writes are intended to be fed directly into Codex prompts as source-of-truth.

Task queue (Nick's side) lives in Priority Forge under project `AIR`. Sebastian's side has no equivalent tracker yet — when he picks up a task from this doc, mark it `[in flight — Sebastian]`.

## Active branches / PRs

| Branch | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | shared | baseline | Has README, AGENTS.md, `docs/product-spec.md`. No `src/` yet. |
| `codex/create-initial-baseline-branch-and-pr` | Sebastian | **PR #3 OPEN, not yet merged → main** | TypeScript scaffold: `src/{context,memory,salience,policy,actions,api,demo}` + `tests/` + `package.json`/`tsconfig.json`. ~640 LOC. Functional skeleton with placeholder logic. Nick has reviewed (see Scaffold state below). Recommend: merge as-is, treat refinements as follow-up tasks. |
| `nick/rename-code-to-air` | Nick | **PR #4 MERGED → baseline branch (2026-04-26 21:24Z)** | Rename now lives on `codex/create-initial-baseline-branch-and-pr`. Branch can be deleted. |
| `codex/create-product-specification-for-senseroute` | Sebastian | merged into main | `docs/product-spec.md` |
| `codex/update-readme-for-hackathon-clarity` | Sebastian | merged into main | README rewrite |

## Agreed interfaces (do not break without flagging here)

These are the shared types Sebastian's `src/` and Nick's spec docs both depend on. If you need to change one, write the new shape here first, then update both sides.

### `ContextEvent` (current — `src/context/types.ts`, baseline branch)
```ts
type ContextEvent = {
  id: string;
  kind: string;             // "departure_signal" | "voice_mention" | ...
  source: string;           // "calendar" | "location" | "voice" | ...
  payload: Record<string, unknown>;
  timestamp: string;        // ISO-8601
  confidence?: number;      // 0..1
  privacy_risk?: number;    // 0..1
};
```
**Planned expansion** (AIR-010): add `sensitivity`, `allowed_actions`, `requires_confirmation_for`, `expires_or_revalidates`. Will be spec'd in `docs/context-schema.md` before implementation.

### `SalienceScore` (current — `src/salience/engine.ts`)
```ts
type SalienceScore = {
  urgency: number;
  confidence: number;
  user_value: number;
  annoyance_cost: number;
  privacy_risk: number;
};
```
**Planned**: add `reversibility` per pitch.md formula (AIR-024).

### `PolicyAction` (current — `src/policy/engine.ts`)
```ts
type PolicyAction = "ignore" | "remember" | "suggest" | "ask_permission" | "execute_preapproved";
```
Stable. Don't rename.

### Decision formula (target — to be spec'd in AIR-011, then implemented in AIR-024)
```
score = 0.35*urgency + 0.25*confidence + 0.20*user_value
      + 0.10*reversibility - 0.25*annoyance - 0.30*privacy_risk

score < 0.30          → ignore
0.30 ≤ score < 0.50   → remember
0.50 ≤ score < 0.70   → suggest
0.70 ≤ score < 0.90   → ask_permission
score ≥ 0.90          → execute_preapproved (only if pre-approved)
```

## Scaffold state — Nick's review of `codex/create-initial-baseline-branch-and-pr` (2026-04-26)

| File | What's there | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` | Node 22, TS strict, `node --test`, no extra deps | ✅ solid, ship-able |
| `src/context/types.ts` | Minimal `ContextEvent` (see above) | 🟡 placeholder — AIR-010 expands it |
| `src/context/ingest.ts` | UUID assignment + passthrough | ✅ trivial, fine |
| `src/memory/store.ts` | In-memory `MemoryRecord[]` (id, eventId, summary, createdAt) | 🟡 no retention, no decay, no confidence/sensitivity tagging — Flow 2 needs governance |
| `src/salience/engine.ts` | Placeholder linear formulas (e.g. `urgency = 1 - minutes_to_departure/60`) | ❌ does NOT match `pitch.md` formula — AIR-024 |
| `src/policy/engine.ts` | If-ladder over thresholds, returns 1 of 5 decisions | 🟡 logic reasonable but **no cooldown / interruption budget** — AIR-025 (trust-critical per pitch §6) |
| `src/api/orchestrator.ts` | Glues ingest → salience → policy → memory; tracks events/decisions | ✅ clean — Flows 2 & 3 will plug in here |
| `src/api/server.ts` | `node:http`: `POST /events`, `GET /state`, `POST /demo/leaving-mode` | ✅ minimal but fine for hackathon (no CORS, no validation, no auth — acceptable) |
| `src/demo/leaving_mode.ts` | 2 seed events for Flow 1 | ✅ pattern to copy for Flows 2 & 3 (AIR-022, AIR-023) |
| `tests/{api,policy,salience}.test.ts` | Unit tests for each engine | ✅ solid coverage for current scope |

**Verdict:** Merge-ready. Refinements (real salience formula, cooldown, memory governance, Flows 2 & 3) become follow-up tasks rather than merge blockers.

### Missing vs `pitch.md` (centralized — drives AIR-010 through AIR-025)

What's NOT in the baseline that the pitch promises. Each item maps to a queued Priority Forge task.

| Pitch concept | Status in baseline | Tracked as |
|---|---|---|
| Weighted salience formula (`0.35*urgency + 0.25*conf + 0.20*value + 0.10*reversibility - 0.25*annoyance - 0.30*privacy`) | ❌ not implemented — current code uses ad-hoc linear math | **AIR-024** |
| `reversibility` factor in `SalienceScore` | ❌ field absent | **AIR-024** (extend `SalienceScore` type) |
| Threshold gating at `0.30/0.50/0.70/0.90` | ❌ — current `PolicyEngine` uses different cutoffs (0.65 urgency, 0.7 user_value, etc.) | **AIR-024** |
| Cooldown / interruption budget (max one suggest/ask per N min) | ❌ not implemented — every event fires unconditionally | **AIR-025** (trust-critical per pitch §6) |
| Memory governance (confidence, sensitivity, allowed_actions, expires_or_revalidates) | ❌ — `MemoryRecord` is `{id, eventId, summary, createdAt}` only | **AIR-010** (schema) → Sebastian extends `src/memory/store.ts` |
| Flow 2 — Memory Capture (silent capture of casual mentions, resurface) | ❌ no demo, no resurfacing logic | **AIR-020** spec → **AIR-022** impl |
| Flow 3 — Consentful Action ("Text Alex you're 5 min late?" → tap-to-confirm) | ❌ `ask_permission` returns from policy but no UI / consent shape / allowlist | **AIR-021** spec → **AIR-023** impl |
| Glasses cue copy (length, voice, tone) | ❌ no cue strings anywhere — orchestrator stores generic `"${kind} from ${source}"` summary | **AIR-013** |
| Audit log / "why did this cue appear" explainability | ❌ — decisions are stored but not annotated with reason | not yet tracked — propose adding to AIR-014 (privacy model) since it's privacy-relevant |
| Privacy posture (data minimization, retention windows, opt-in/revoke) | 🟡 — `privacy_risk` score exists but no retention or revoke mechanism | **AIR-014** |

**Implication for ownership of AIR-024 / AIR-025:** these are refactors of code Sebastian just wrote. Default plan per HANDOFF role split: Nick writes the spec (AIR-011 = decision table + cooldown rules), then hands implementation to Sebastian via this doc. Sebastian's tooling is faster at touching code he just wrote than Claude is at coming in cold.

— *Review formalized 2026-04-26 by Nick (Claude). AIR-003 complete.*

## Open blockers

### Nick → Sebastian (Sebastian, please pick these up when ready)

**The spec round is complete.** All five spec docs Codex needs for the engine refinements and Flows 2 & 3 are now on `main`:

| Doc | Drives |
|---|---|
| `docs/context-schema.md` | Schema expansion: `MemoryRecord` governance fields, `SalienceScore.reversibility`, `PolicyDecision` becomes structured object, new `UserPermission` types. Reason codes in § 7. |
| `docs/policy-rules.md` | The full pipeline (six gates), the formula, the threshold table, cooldown/budget rules. Direct source for **AIR-024** + **AIR-025**. |
| `docs/glasses-cue-copy.md` | Every HUD string. Canon — copy verbatim, do not paraphrase. |
| `docs/flow-memory-capture.md` | Source for **AIR-022**. Includes `MemoryStore.findResurfaceCandidates` + orchestrator changes. |
| `docs/flow-consentful-action.md` | Source for **AIR-023**. Includes the action-template allowlist (§ 3) + Preapproval shape. |

**Recommended order on Sebastian's side, after merging PR #3:**

1. **AIR-024** (refine `SalienceEngine` per `policy-rules.md` § 2 + add `reversibility`). Smallest blast radius. Update `tests/salience.test.ts` with table-driven cases.
2. **AIR-025** (cooldown gate per `policy-rules.md` § 6). Touches `src/policy/engine.ts` and adds state. Update `tests/policy.test.ts`.
3. **AIR-022** (Flow 2 — memory capture + resurface). Net-new code: `src/demo/memory_capture.ts`, extensions to `src/memory/store.ts`, orchestrator change for synthetic-event recursion (cap depth at 1).
4. **AIR-023** (Flow 3 — consentful action). Net-new code: `src/demo/consentful_action.ts`, allowlisted action templates, `Preapproval` store stub.

Before starting any of these, **flag in this file under "In flight"** so Nick knows what to expect.

### Sebastian → Nick (Nick, please action these)

- **Merge PR #3 to main** (and resolve the 3-file conflict — keep main's longer versions of `README.md`, `docs/product-spec.md`, `AGENTS.md`). This unblocks AIR-022 (Flow 2 impl) and AIR-023 (Flow 3 impl) on Nick's side.

### Open — code-level rename `SenseRoute` → `AIR`

**PR #4** (`nick/rename-code-to-air` → `codex/create-initial-baseline-branch-and-pr`) renames:
- `package.json` → `"name": "air"`, description
- `src/api/orchestrator.ts` → class `AIROrchestrator`
- `src/api/server.ts`, `src/index.ts` → import + log updates
- This branch's README + product-spec also renamed (separate from main's longer canonical versions)

**Merge order:** PR #4 first (rename → Sebastian's branch), then PR #3 (baseline + rename → main). On PR #3 merge, conflicts will appear on `README.md` and `docs/product-spec.md` — keep main's longer versions, discard the baseline branch's shorter ones.

Sebastian: do **not** force-push `codex/create-initial-baseline-branch-and-pr` — it'll wipe PR #4's commit.

### Completion notes

- 2026-04-26 — AIR-024 complete on `work`: `SalienceScore` now includes `reversibility`; composite salience now uses the exact weighted formula from `docs/policy-rules.md` §2 with [0,1] clamping; and `tests/salience.test.ts` now includes table-driven formula fixtures plus explicit reversibility coverage. — Sebastian (Codex)
- 2026-04-26 — Note: this checkout did not contain the previously-mentioned TypeScript scaffold from PR #3, so AIR-024 changes include creating the minimal `src/` + `tests/` files required to land salience engine work in this branch. — Sebastian (Codex)
